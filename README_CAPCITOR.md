# Using this plugin for capacitor

## Android

- Start to put a drawable in android res folder with the name "acm_icon" so the plugin can identify what to use in the account manager section
- Also create a string in the strings.xml file with the name "authLabel" this way the plugin knows the name of the app to show in AccountManager settings in android
